A small console based project called Barracks (the code for it is included in the provided skeleton).
The general functionality the project has is adding new units to its repository and printing a report with statistics about the units currently in the repository. First let's go over the original task before the project was created:
Input
The input consists of commands each on a separate line. Commands that execute the functionality are:
•	add <Archer/Swordsman/Pikeman/{…}> - adds a unit to the repository.
•	report - prints a lexicological ordered statistic about the units in the repository.
•	fight - ends the input.
Output
Each command except fight should print output on the console.
•	add should print: "<Archer/Swordsman/Pikeman/{…}> added!"
•	report should print all the info in the repository in the format: "<UnitType> -> <UnitQuantity>", sorted by UnitType
•	retire <UnitType> - All it has to do is remove a unit of the provided type from the repository.
  o	If there are no such units currently in the repository print: "No such units in repository."
  o	If there is such a unit currently in the repository, print: "<UnitType> retired!"
