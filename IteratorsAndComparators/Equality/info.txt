Create a class Person holding name and age. A person with the same name and age should be considered the same, override any methods needed to 
enforce this logic. Your class should work with both standard and hashed collections. Create a TreeSet and a HashSet of type Person.
Input
On the first line of input you will receive a number N. On each of the next N lines you will receive information about people in the format 
"<name> <age>".  Add the people from the input into both sets (both sets should hold all the people passed in from the input). 
Output
The output should consist of exactly 2 lines. On the first you should print the size of the TreeSet and on the second - the size of the HashSet
